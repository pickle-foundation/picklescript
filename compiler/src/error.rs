//!
//! Codes are grouped by area (`E01xx` lexing/parsing, `E02xx` name
//! resolution and declarations, `E03xx`-`E04xx` type checking and
//! operations, `E05xx` ownership/memory, `E06xx`-`E07xx` object model and
//! references, `E09xx` the gap between the checker and the code generator).
//!
//! The catalogue entries back the `pickle explain <CODE>` subcommand and the
