# PickleScript — Memory Model

## Default: garbage collected

Normal PickleScript code never mentions memory.

```
class Account {
    name: string
    transactions: List<int>
}

fn main() {
    let a = Account("Ada")
    let b = a                // shared reference
    let copy = Object.clone(a) // only if you ask
}
```

- Assignments copy *values* (structs, primitives) and share *references*
  (classes, strings, collections).
- Objects are allocated on a GC heap, moved in/out of functions by
  reference. No ownership, no lifetimes, no let/const/borrow ceremony in
  safe code.
- Locals, fields, collection elements are all managed uniformly.
- Strings are immutable and UTF-8; substring/slice operations copy.

## Deterministic memory: `#[manualAlloc]`

Safe PickleScript is garbage collected. When you want to control exactly when
an object dies — a pool, a mesh, a buffer, a node in a hot loop — annotate the
binding with `#[manualAlloc]`:

```
#[manualAlloc]
let mesh = Mesh("terrain")
// ... use mesh ...
mesh.free()                       // runs deinit(), returns the memory now
```

Rules:

- The initializer must construct a `class` or `struct` object.
- A `#[manualAlloc]` binding is the object's **single owner**. While it is
  live the collector never reclaims the object and never runs its `deinit`;
  the object counts as a GC root, so anything it references stays alive too.
- `free()` runs `deinit` (if any) exactly once, then releases the memory back
  to the heap for reuse. Calling `free()` a second time, or reading the
  binding after `free()`, is a compile error.
- `free()` is only valid on a manual binding. Annotating a binding whose type
  is not a class/struct, passing arguments to the attribute, or using an
  unknown attribute is a compile error.

A manual object can be **moved** to another owner. Assigning it to a new
`#[manualAlloc]` binding, passing it to a `#[manualAlloc]` parameter, or
returning it from a `#[manualAlloc]` function transfers ownership; the old
binding can no longer be used:

```
#[manualAlloc]
let mesh = Mesh("terrain")
#[manualAlloc]
let other = mesh              // moves out of `mesh`
// mesh.load()                // error: use after move
other.free()
```

A function can own what it receives and what it returns:

```
fn consume(#[manualAlloc] w: Widget) {
    w.free()                  // callee owns `w`
}

#[manualAlloc]
fn make() -> Widget {
    return Widget(1)          // caller now owns the result
}
```

A `#[manualAlloc]` function result must be consumed into an owned position — a
`#[manualAlloc] let`, an owned parameter, or an owned return — otherwise it is
reported as a leak. You can call an owned parameter with a fresh allocation
directly (`consume(Widget(1))`); the callee adopts it at entry.

Owned **fields** make an object responsible for a manual child. Annotate the
field and give it an explicit type and an initializer:

```
class Node {
    value: int
}

class Tree {
    #[manualAlloc] root: Node = Node(0)
}

#[manualAlloc]
let tree = Tree()
tree.free()                   // frees `tree`, then `root`, recursively
```

- An owned field must be a `class`/`struct` type, must be an instance field
  (not `static`/`const`), and must be assigned an explicit type plus an
  initializer. Like any other field it can be reassigned later.
- Assigning to an owned field takes ownership: the value must be a fresh
  allocation or a moved `#[manualAlloc]` binding. The value the field held is
  released first, so reassignment never leaks.
- Freeing the holder — explicitly with `free()`, or implicitly when a
  GC-managed holder is swept — releases its owned fields recursively. Owned
  fields follow their holder everywhere, including through inheritance.
- Cycles between owned fields are rejected at run time rather than looping:
  each block is released at most once.

Storing a manual value into an ordinary managed field is still a compile
error: an owned value must stay in an owned position. Raw pointers live in
`unsafe`; there are no lifetimes and no borrow checker — the model is "one
owner, free it once".

## Collector

The v1 collector is a **non-moving, stop-the-world, mark-and-sweep GC**
with the following properties:

- Threads report live references through a **shadow stack** managed by the
  compiler: the function prologue allocates a fixed-size slot frame,
  registers it with the runtime's thread-local GC data, and codegen spills
  every live managed pointer into its slot around each GC safe point
  (allocation, function call, channel send, await).
- Allocation is a bump/small-region allocation over a free-list triaged by
  size class.
- Sweeping returns dead objects to the free list; consecutive free blocks
  coalesce.
- Weak references exist (`weak T`) but do not keep objects alive.
- Finalizers (`deinit`) run during sweep, off the allocation path, at most
  once per dead object, in unspecified order; they must not allocate. They are
  best-effort: an object that is never reclaimed (e.g. live until exit) is
  never finalized.
- A fresh allocation is pinned across the collection its own allocation may
  trigger, so an object under construction is never swept (or finalized)
  before its constructor can store it.
- The GC is **incremental-izable** later; v1 reserves a stop-the-world
  pause for simplicity and predictability.

## Safe vs unsafe

```
class Account {
    var branch: string
}

#[manualAlloc]
let account = Account("Ada")           // safe: deterministic owner

unsafe {
    let ptr: *Account = &account       // raw address of a managed object
    ptr.branch = "NYC"                 // `.` auto-dereferences a raw pointer
    println((*ptr).branch)             // explicit dereference
}
account.free()
```

`unsafe { }` is a scope: inside it the raw-pointer operators below are
allowed, and the block's value is its tail expression (like any block).

Implemented today:

- `*T` raw pointer types (`let ptr: *Account = ...`).
- `&expr` address-of, `*p` dereference.
- Field access through a pointer: `p.field` auto-dereferences (there is no
  separate `->` operator; `(*p).field` is always available).
- Assigning through a pointer to a class, struct, or pointer value:
  `*p = v` rebinds the pointer, and `p.field = v` writes the field.
- Scalar raw pointers: `*int`, `*float`, `*bool`, `*char` hold the address
  of a local, and `*p` reads / `(*p) = v` writes through them. A scalar
  pointer is carried as an unmanaged address (never GC-tracked). Address-of
  a scalar requires a local variable, so `&n` is legal but `&(1 + 2)` is not.
- Raw buffers: `alloc(T, count)` / `free(p)` over an unmanaged block and
  `p[i]` element reads/writes with stride (see "Raw buffers" below).

Line-leading `*`: the parser reads a line that starts with `*` as a
multiplication continuation, so a store through a scalar pointer on its own
line uses the parenthesized form `(*p) = v` (or `;` to end the previous
statement).

### Raw buffers (`alloc` / `free` / indexing)

```
unsafe {
    var buf: *int = alloc(int, 8)    // 8 ints, 64 raw bytes
    buf[0] = 10
    buf[1] = 20
    buf[2] = buf[0] + buf[1]
    println(buf[2])                  // element read
    free(buf)
}
```

- `alloc(T, count)` returns `*T` over a non-GC block; `free(p)` releases it.
  Both are `unsafe`-only. Element type `T` must be a scalar (`int`, `float`,
  `bool`, `char`); a buffer holding managed values is not lowered, because
  the GC never traces raw memory and would collect a stored object as a
  PickleObject.
- `p[i]` reads and `p[i] = v` writes the `i`-th element, scaled by the
  element stride: 8 bytes for `int`/`float`, 4 for `char`, 1 for `bool`.
  Compound forms (`p[i] += v`) load-modify-store.
- Blocks are uninitialized: initialize an element before reading it. Reads
  of never-written elements are whatever the allocator left in memory.
- `free(p)` is checked: freeing a pointer that was not allocated (double
  free, foreign pointer) reports `fatal: pickle: raw free of a pointer that
  was not allocated (double free?)` through the runtime panic path and exits.
- The checker does not track a raw buffer past `free`; the runtime registry
  catches double frees, but a buffer used after being freed is unchecked
  (like C).

Rules enforced by the type checker:

- `&` and `*` (and pointer field access) are only legal inside `unsafe`.
- `&` accepts class, struct, pointer, and scalar values; a scalar operand
  must be a local binding. `*p` requires `p` to be a raw pointer.
- Pointer values are non-owning: they neither keep an object alive nor free
  it. A `#[manualAlloc]` owner still performs the deterministic free.

### Immutable references (`&T` parameters)

An `&T` parameter is a read-only lens on its argument: the caller borrows the
value automatically and there is no `&` at the call site. It is not a
Rust-style borrow — there are no lifetimes, no borrow checker, and a borrow
never blocks reads, calls, or re-borrows. The only rule is that a `&T` can be
read through and never written through.

```
fn receipt(items: &List<int>, total: &int) -> int {
    var sum = total[0]          // `&int` reads the caller's local in place
    for (v in items) {          // iteration dereferences the list referent
        sum = sum + v
    }
    return sum
}

fn main() {
    var p = 1000
    var price = [3, 5]
    println(receipt(price, p))  // implicit borrow, no `&`
}
```

When `T` is smaller than a word you don't need to understand the mechanics: a
`&int` is carried as the address of the argument's storage, so `*p` and
`p[0]` alias its memory between the call's start and end. Because the borrow
cannot write, a call cannot observe its own side effect through the alias.

Semantics and rules:

- `&T` is allowed only as a function, method, or constructor parameter type.
  Uses elsewhere are rejected: `let x: &int`, fields, `const`, return types,
  lambda return types — all error with "`&T` references are supported only as
  function parameter types".
- Callers pass the bare value; the compiler borrows implicitly. An explicit
  `&c` still yields a raw `*T` (an `unsafe` operation) and is *not* a way to
  satisfy `&T`.
- Reading is fully supported through a `&T`: `*p` and `p[0]` for scalars,
  `p.field`, `p.method(...)`, `p[i]`, and `for (v in p)` — each dereferences
  the referent. Class/struct referents pass by identity; `&int`-style referents
  pass by address of a local.
- Writing is always rejected, inside or outside `unsafe`: `(*p) = v` and
  `p[i] = v` ("cannot write through an immutable reference (`&T`)"), and
  `p.field = v` ("cannot write to a field ... through an immutable reference").
- Borrowing a `#[manualAlloc]` value does not move or free it — the borrowed
  node can be read through several `&T` parameters and the owner still frees
  it exactly once (`node.free()`).
- `List<&T>` is rejected for GC safety ("lists of `&T` references are not
  supported yet"): a list element cannot be a non-owning reference.

The syntax is reserved for these references only; the pointer operators above
are unchanged.

## Custom allocators and arenas

For engine-style code:

```
arena Arena<SceneData> {           // region allocation
    ...
}

let scratch = Arena()
let item = scratch.alloc(Vec<Collider>())
// freed as a whole when scratch goes out of scope
```

Design: `Arena<T>` is a class in the stdlib; custom *global* allocators are
registered through the runtime (`SetGlobalAllocator`) and participate in GC
as non-moving spaces in v1. Manual heap (`malloc`/`free`) is
`unsafe`-gated.

## Pointers and references — precise rules

| Syntax          | Meaning                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `&expr`         | address of a class/struct/pointer value, or a scalar local |
| `*T`            | raw pointer type (unsafe only)           |
| `&T`            | immutable-reference parameter type (implicit borrow) |
| `*ptr`          | dereference (read a scalar pointee)      |
| `(*ptr) = v`    | store through a scalar/pointer pointee   |
| `ptr.field`     | field through a raw pointer (auto-deref) |
| `p[n]`          | index through pointer: element read/write with stride (unsafe) |
| `alloc(T, n)`   | raw buffer of `n` scalar `T`s (unsafe)    |
| `free(p)`       | release a raw buffer (unsafe, checked)    |

`*T` is a non-owning pointer. There is no manual free in safe code, and the
`#[manualAlloc]` owner is still what frees the object.

## GC and the C side

The runtime exports a C ABI (`extern "C"`) surface:

- `pickle_gc_alloc`, `pickle_gc_alloc_string`
- `pickle_gc_register_thread` / `pickle_gc_unregister_thread`
- `pickle_gc_collect(force: bool)`
- `pickle_allocator_set` (custom allocator)

The compiler generates code against this ABI; a future FFI layer reuses the
same surface.

## Closures

A closure value is a managed object of a synthetic per-capture-count class
(`__closure_N`, one class for every supported number of captures). Its slot 0
holds the hoisted body's code address; slots 1..N hold the captured values,
boxed like list elements and marked as traced fields. Because the captures
live in a traced object, a closure keeps them alive as long as the closure
itself is reachable, and a closure returned from a function (or stored in
another object) behaves like any other value. See `docs/02-syntax.md` for the
source-level rules and `examples/closures`.

## Object layout

```
struct PickleObjectHeader {
    next:      *mut PickleObject,  // GC free-list/live-list link
    class_id:  u32,
    flags:     u32,                // mark, etc.
    size:      u32,                // total object bytes
    _pad:      u32,
}   // 24 bytes

struct PString  { header, len: usize, bytes: [u8] }
struct PList    { header, len, cap, data: *mut void }  // element-kind tag in class table
struct PMap     { header, entries: *mut Entry, len, cap }
```

Class descriptors are emitted by the compiler into the generated object
image; each carries `field_count`, a managed-field bitmask, and a name, so
the collector marks exactly the pointer-bearing fields and no others.

## Safety guarantees summarized

- Safe code: no use-after-free, no double-free, no null deref (options
  checked statically), no buffer overrun in bounds-checked indexing.
- Unsafe code: the developer is responsible for the same invariants the GC
  would have preserved; mismatches are caught best-effort in debug builds
  (`-D` enables poison + bounds checks everywhere).
- All heap allocation paths are GC safe points by construction.
