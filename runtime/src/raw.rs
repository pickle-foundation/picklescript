//! Raw manual memory for `unsafe` programs: `pickle_raw_alloc` / `pickle_raw_free`.

//! `alloc(int, n)` hands back a plain heap block that the GC never traces;

//! exists only to catch the obvious double-free / foreign-free mistakes; it is
//! not a safety mechanism (a dangling pointer used before `free` is unchecked,
//! exactly like C).
