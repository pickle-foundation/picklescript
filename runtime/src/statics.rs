//! Class static-field storage.
//!
//! Every static field of a user class gets one stable cell
//! (`*mut *mut PickleObject`) indexed by `(class_id, static_slot)`. Cells are
//! allocated lazily on first access and registered as GC roots, so objects
//! referenced by static fields stay alive across collections. Values follow the
//! same representation rules as class instance slots and list elements: every
//! cell holds a managed pointer (boxed scalars, strings, class instances…).
